# Blog Platform

## Overview

This software allows users to write blogs and read the ones other users published. It also has filtering features, so users can easily find blogs that they want to read. There are two ways of filtering. One way is to select a category of the ones listed under the menu bar in the home screen, then the software will display all of the blogs tagged with that category. Another way is to navigate to the categories page and select a category of the ones available. Also, the user can use a search bar in the menu bar to find blogs by title. Aside the filtering and searching features, the software also allows the users to subscribe and unsubscribe to the publisher of a blog, so they can later find blogs from the publisher in the subscriptions page. Another feature is the liking system where users can like a blog, and for each blog, the software displays the number of likes the blog received.
